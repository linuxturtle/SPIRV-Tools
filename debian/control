Description: API and commands for processing SPIR-V modules
 The project includes an assembler, binary module parser, disassembler,
 validator, and optimizer for SPIR-V. Except for the optimizer, all are
 based on a common static library. The library contains all of the
 implementation details, and is used in the standalone tools whilst
 also enabling integration into other code bases directly. The
 optimizer implementation resides in its own library, which depends on
 the core library.
